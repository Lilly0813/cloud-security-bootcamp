# AWS Security Labs by Lilly

This repo showcases my hands-on practice in securing AWS environments. All labs are based on real-world security use cases, aligned with the AWS Security Specialty certification. 

Each folder contains lab notes, architecture diagrams, policies, and scripts to demonstrate:
- Identity & access management (IAM)
- Threat detection with GuardDuty
- Data protection using KMS
- Secure VPC and S3 configurations
- Automated security monitoring

ðŸ’¡ *These labs were built from scratch to deepen my understanding and prepare for AWS cloud security roles.*
